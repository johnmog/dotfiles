**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Analysis Type:** Comprehensive Security Audit  
**Repository:** johnmog/dotfiles  

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive security analysis of the dotfiles repository and the associated environment. The analysis includes:
- Automated secret scanning with gitleaks
- Manual credential pattern analysis
- Environment variable analysis
- File permission checks
- Script security review
- Broader security concerns

### Overall Security Status: **GOOD** ✅

No exposed secrets or critical vulnerabilities were found in the repository or environment. Several areas for improvement have been identified.

---

## 1. Secret Scanning Results

### 1.1 Automated Scanning (Gitleaks)

**Repository Scan:**
- ✅ **PASSED** - No secrets found in current repository state
- ✅ **PASSED** - No secrets found in git history

**Tool:** Gitleaks v8.18.2  
**Commits Scanned:** All commits in repository history  
**Findings:** 0 leaks detected

### 1.2 Manual Pattern Analysis

**Credential Patterns Analyzed:**
- Password/passwd patterns
- Token patterns
- API key patterns
- Secret patterns
- Auth/authentication patterns

**Findings:**
- ✅ All matches are legitimate configuration references
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials found
- ✅ No URLs with embedded credentials

**Details:**
- `.zshrc` contains reference to optional `.secrets` file - **SAFE** (file is in .gitignore)
- `.gitconfig` contains git credential helper configuration - **SAFE** (uses gh auth)
- `.shellrc/zshrc/alias.rc` contains SSH key alias - **SAFE** (only references public key)

---

## 2. Environment Analysis

### 2.1 Environment Variables

**Sensitive Variable Categories Found:**
- ⚠️ GitHub workflow-related variables (GITHUB_*, COPILOT_*)
- ⚠️ API endpoint variables (COPILOT_API_URL, GITHUB_API_URL)

**Assessment:** These are GitHub Actions environment variables provided by the CI/CD system. They are not user secrets and are expected in this context.

### 2.2 Credential Files

| File/Directory | Status | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| `~/.ssh/` | ✅ Not present | No SSH keys in environment |
| `~/.secrets` | ✅ Not present | Referenced in .zshrc but doesn't exist |
| `~/.git-credentials` | ✅ Not present | No git credentials stored |
| `~/.aws/` | ✅ Not present | No AWS credentials |
| `~/.docker/config.json` | ⚠️ Present | Contains Docker Hub authentication |
| `~/.kube/config` | ✅ Not present | No Kubernetes credentials |

### 2.3 Docker Configuration

**Finding:** Docker config file exists with authentication data for Docker Hub.

**Assessment:** This is expected in a GitHub Actions environment and is managed by GitHub. The credentials are not exposed in the repository.

**Recommendation:** No action needed - this is normal for CI/CD environments.

---

## 3. Repository Security Analysis

### 3.1 .gitignore Configuration

✅ **PROPERLY CONFIGURED**

The `.gitignore` file includes:
- `.secrets` - prevents accidental commit of secrets file

**Recommendation:** Consider adding additional patterns:
```
# Sensitive files
*.pem
*.key
*.p12
.env
.env.local

# Cloud provider credentials
.aws/
.gcloud/
.azure/

# IDE settings that might contain sensitive data
.vscode/settings.json
```

### 3.2 SSH Key Handling

✅ **SECURE IMPLEMENTATION**

The `pkey` alias in `.shellrc/zshrc/alias.rc` is properly implemented:
- Only references the PUBLIC key (`id_rsa.pub`)
- Never exposes or handles the private key
- Includes error handling for missing key file

### 3.3 Secrets File Pattern

⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE WITH CAUTION**

The `.zshrc` file sources `$HOME/.secrets` if it exists:
```bash
if [ -f "$HOME/.secrets" ]; then
  source "$HOME/.secrets"
fi
```

**Assessment:**
- This pattern is common for managing local secrets
- The `.secrets` file is properly excluded in `.gitignore`
- File does not exist in the current environment

**Recommendation:** Document the expected format/contents of `.secrets` file for users.

---

## 4. Script Security Analysis

### 4.1 Remote Code Execution Patterns

⚠️ **CONCERNS IDENTIFIED** in `bootstrap.sh`

**Findings:**
```bash
Line 86:  curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
Line 105: if curl -o- "$NVM_INSTALL_URL" | bash; then
```

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** These patterns execute remote scripts without verification, which could be exploited if:
- The remote server is compromised
- DNS is hijacked
- There's a man-in-the-middle attack

**Recommendations:**
1. Download scripts first, verify checksums, then execute
2. Use specific version tags instead of latest
3. Consider vendoring installation scripts

**Mitigation:** The scripts are from reputable sources (starship.rs, nvm-sh), reducing risk.

### 4.2 Privileged Operations

⚠️ **SUDO USAGE IDENTIFIED**

**Findings:** Multiple sudo operations in `bootstrap.sh`:
- Installing fd to `/usr/local/bin/`
- Installing prettyping with wget
- Making files executable
- Changing default shell
- Installing packages with apt-get

**Assessment:** All sudo usage is legitimate and necessary for system-level installations.

**Risk Level:** LOW

**Recommendation:** These operations are appropriate for a bootstrap script.

### 4.3 Input Validation

✅ **GOOD IMPLEMENTATION**

**Positive Security Features Found:**
1. Error checking with `set -e` at start of bootstrap.sh
2. Input validation in shell functions (e.g., checking for empty parameters)
3. Path traversal protection in bootstrap.sh (line 138-140)
4. Security comments noting validation checks

**Example of good validation:**
```bash
# Security: Validate filename to prevent path traversal
if [[ "$file" =~ \.\./|\.\. || "$file" =~ ^/ ]]; then
    log "WARNING: Skipping potentially unsafe file: $file"
    continue
fi
```

### 4.4 Temporary File Handling

✅ **SECURE IMPLEMENTATION**

**Findings:**
- Uses unique temp directories with PID suffix: `/tmp/autojump-$$`
- Verifies directory contents before executing scripts
- Cleans up temp directories after use

### 4.5 Path Validation

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Good Security Practice Found:** In `bootstrap.sh`, the `install_zsh_plugin` function validates destination directories:
```bash
# Security: Validate destination directory is within expected path
if [[ "$dest_dir" != "$ZSH_CUSTOM"* ]]; then
    log "ERROR: Destination directory outside of ZSH_CUSTOM: $dest_dir"
    return 1
fi
```

## 5. Additional Security Observations

### 5.1 Git Configuration

The `.gitconfig` uses GitHub CLI for credential management:
```
[credential "https://github.com"]
    helper = !/opt/homebrew/bin/gh auth git-credential
```

✅ This is a secure approach that leverages GitHub's OAuth authentication.

### 5.2 Shell History Configuration

The `.zshrc` includes good security practices:
- `HIST_IGNORE_SPACE` - Commands starting with space won't be saved (useful for commands with secrets)
- Large history size for forensics and auditing

### 5.3 File Permissions

No issues with file permissions detected in the repository. All scripts have appropriate execute permissions.

---

## 6. Recommendations

### High Priority
1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Ensure `.secrets` is in `.gitignore` (already done)
2. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Verify no secrets in git history (verified clean)

### Medium Priority
3. Consider improving the curl|bash patterns in bootstrap.sh:
   ```bash
   # Instead of: curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
   # Use:
   curl -sS -o /tmp/starship-install.sh https://starship.rs/install.sh
   # Optionally verify checksum here
   sh /tmp/starship-install.sh
   rm /tmp/starship-install.sh
   ```

4. Expand `.gitignore` to include more secret file patterns (see section 3.1)

5. Document the `.secrets` file format in README:
   ```
   # Create ~/.secrets file with your environment-specific secrets:
   export MY_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   export MY_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   ```

### Low Priority
6. Consider adding pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets before committing
7. Add periodic secret scanning to CI/CD pipeline
8. Document security best practices in README

---

## 7. Compliance Considerations

### GDPR/Privacy
- ✅ No personal data exposed in repository
- ✅ Email in .gitconfig is public GitHub email (johnmog@github.com)

### Best Practices
- ✅ Uses credential helpers instead of storing passwords
- ✅ Properly excludes sensitive files
- ✅ Includes input validation in scripts
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or API keys

---
