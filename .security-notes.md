# Security Notes for Dotfiles

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Download Security
- **Fixed**: Updated fd version from 8.7.1 (2022) to 10.2.0 (2024)
- **Fixed**: Added checksum verification framework for fd binary (commented out - requires actual checksums)
- **Fixed**: Improved file download handling with temporary files

### 2. Path Traversal Protection
- **Fixed**: Added validation for symlink creation to prevent `../` path traversal attacks
- **Fixed**: Added input validation for zsh plugin installation paths

### 3. Variable Security
- **Fixed**: Added proper quoting for all variables
- **Fixed**: Added input validation for function parameters
- **Fixed**: Used unique temporary directories with PID to prevent conflicts

### 4. SSH Key Security
- **Fixed**: Improved SSH key alias to check file existence and never expose private key paths
- **Fixed**: Added error handling for missing public key files

### 5. Directory Security
- **Fixed**: Added validation for repository directory creation
- **Fixed**: Added error handling for directory operations

## Remaining Security Considerations

### 1. Script Downloads (MEDIUM RISK)
The following patterns download and execute scripts from the internet:
- Homebrew installation: `curl -fsSL ... | bash`
- Oh My Zsh installation: `curl -fsSL ... | sh`
- Vim Plug installation: `curl -fLo ...`

**Mitigation**: Added security warnings. Consider downloading, reviewing, and executing manually.

### 2. Binary Checksums (LOW RISK)
While framework is in place, actual checksums are not verified due to the need for current release checksums.

**Mitigation**: Uncomment checksum verification once actual SHA256 hashes are obtained.

### 3. Git Repository Trust (LOW RISK)
Multiple git repositories are cloned over HTTPS without GPG signature verification.

**Mitigation**: Consider using SSH for known repositories or adding GPG verification.

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs and parameters are validated
2. **Path Sanitization**: File paths are checked for traversal attempts
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling prevents silent failures
4. **Least Privilege**: No unnecessary sudo operations
5. **Secure Defaults**: Conservative file permissions maintained
6. **Logging**: Security events are logged for auditing

## Recommended Actions

1. Obtain current SHA256 checksums for fd binary and uncomment verification
2. Consider using SSH for git operations where possible
3. Review and manually execute third-party scripts before automation
4. Regularly update dependency versions
5. Monitor for security updates in used tools and frameworks

## File Permissions

All files maintain appropriate permissions:
- Scripts: 755 (executable by owner, readable by all)
- Configuration: 644 (readable by owner and group, readable by others)
- No world-writable files
